Subject: [Delilinux-user] Public Apology to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and
 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore
Message-ID: <4DBC4B77.7090708@gmail.com>

I was misconstrued as having insulted Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. My 
words were twisted and misinterpreted and I feel that there is a need to 
explain myself and set the record straight.

[b]What really happened[/b]

It was sometime in Aug/Sep in the year 2009. The setting was in the 
Tampines Central office of Asiasoft Online Pte Ltd. I was having a 
***verbal*** conversation with Melvin Lee, my new I.T. department 
manager, when he challenged me to complete an I.T. assignment within a 
specified period of time. In response to his challenge, I replied in 
Mandarin: "If I cannot complete the I.T. assignment within a specified 
period of time, then Lee Kuan Yew is wang ba dan". I used to be fond of 
using other people's names to "bet" with people but now no more. The 
Minister Mentor's name came into my mind spontaneously and I used it to 
"bet" with my I.T. department manager.

[b]Explanations[/b]

1. It was not my intention to insult the Minister Mentor at that time. 
Please note the use of the IF... THEN... statement in my verbal 
conversation.

2. I did not know wang ba dan [hanyu pinyin] means bastard at all until 
I consulted Goh Meng Seng much later.

I would like to apologize to the Minister Mentor and the Prime Minister 
of Singapore if I have offended them in any way. I swear it was not my 
intention to insult the Minister Mentor. Please forgive me for using 
your name carelessly to "bet" with my former I.T. department manager.


Yours sincerely,
