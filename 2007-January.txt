Subject: [Delilinux-user] How to install DeLi-32 ? (tutorial for
	linux-beginners)
Message-ID: <45BA4B8A.7070407@gmx.de>

Hello!

I would like to install DeLi-32 on an old PC with 500 Mhz, 64 MB RAM, 12 GB HD.

It should be used by a really beginner only th surf the web.

Im not very expericened with installing linux; I read this about DeLi-32, but I 
dont know how to install it ... I only find files for the 3 applications.

Is there any iso-file for DeLi-32, which I can burn to a bootable-CD, which runs 
an setup on startup?

Thanks,
Nyks

It seems there is a misunderstanding. Deli-32 is not a seperate distribution, it's just a 
software repository fpr computers with at least 32 MB RAM, see http://delili.lens.hl-users.com/wiki/doku.php?id=software:deli-32.

If you want to install software packages from the DeLi-32 repository you have to install DeLi in the
first place. For installation see http://delili.lens.hl-users.com/wiki/doku.php?id=installation:cdrom

Henry

who wishes that people would recognize the wiki, it's not that hard to find...

Hi, I don't know what kind of changes have been made in the install process
since I used version 0.6,
but it's not hard at all. If you read the FAQ, Also about only seeing 3
items, did you just burn the file
to a CD or did you make it from a CD image? Another thing is that if your
system doesn't boot the CD
it's self you'll likely have that result. And follow what's being asked from
the install process you
can figure it out. As for surfing the web, again I don't know what changes
have been done since but
you'll likely have to download the browser, though getting something like
Firefox shouldn't be hard.
