Hello,

here in detail. what i did:
--
LILO (linux Loader) is a generic boot loader. There's a simple
installation which tries to automatically set up LILO to boot
Linux (also Windows if found). For more advanced users, the 
expert option offers more control over the installation
process. Since LILO does not work in all cases (ald can damage
partitions if incorrectly installed), there's the third (save)
option, which is to skip installing LILO for now and you con 
always install it later with the 'liloconfig' command.

-> simple

LILO can be installed to a variety of places:
1) The superblock of your root Linux partition. (which could
   be made the bootable partition with Windows or Linux fdisk, or
   booted with a programm like OS/2 Boot Manager)
2) A formatted floppy disk.
3) The Master Boot record of your first hard drive.
Options 1 and 2 are the safest, but option 1 does require a little
extra work later (setting the partition bootable with fdisk).
which option would you like?

-> Root

Sorry, but the attempt to install LILO has returned an
error, so LILO has not been correctly instlalled. You'll 
have to use a bootdisk to start your machine instead.
It should still be possible to get LILO working by
editing the /etc/lilo.conf and reinstalling LILO
manually. See the LILO man page and documentation in
/usr/doc/lilo for more help.

So, how can i boot this system and how can i try to
make my disk bootable?

Thanks for help,

Michael.

Message-ID: <002001c782a4$feaac3c0$df64fea9@ccpg576d>

Salve,
I am a newbie.
I installed deli linux 7.1 on a pentium S (32Mb Ram, 2Gb HD) where windows 98 had already installed. I I reduced the partition for windows 98 and I created a swap linux partition on hda2 a 3 linux partitions at hda5, hda6, hda7 before installing deli linux. I installed deli linux in hda5 and Ichoosed not to create a swap partition (it was already created) then I was asked weather I would choose hda2 as swap partition: I confirmed. But deli linux does not recognise hda2 swap partition. When booting I read a line:
'unable to find swap-space signature' and:
'swapon: /dev/hda2: Invalid argument'

Another problem is that when I run startx I can see only a tool bar in the bottom of a black screen (is that related with te above problem?) and the mouse does not work. I have a serial mouse on COM2. I tried xorgconfig and I choosed 'auto detect' and then /dev/ttyS1 but it does not work.

Many thanks for help me and sorry for, possibly, stupid questions.
Giuseppe

Salve,
I am a newbie.
I installed deli linux on a pentium S (32 Mb RAM, on a 350 Mb linux partition) with also windows 98. 
I setup tiny X but the mouse does not work. I have a serial mouse (2 buttons) on COM2. I read the instructions 
in your mailing list about a similar problem: I changed xorgconfig according to my mouse type and adding /dev/ttyS1.
When I startx the mouse does not work. 
I also did (according to your list on a similar problem):

cd /usr/bin
cp X X.old
rm X
ln -s /usr/bin/Xorg X

then I ran xorgconfig putting /dev/ttyS1 and I started Xorg: the mouse worked but the I had half black screen without toolbar. 
Also when I startx there was an error and it did not work. So I set up again Tiny X: the screen works but the mouse still does not work.

Could someone help me I would be very grateful. 
Thank you for help.
Giuseppe
