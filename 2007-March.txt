Subject: [Delilinux-user] A request for your input.
Message-ID: <20070320171233.qehtkr2yo4ksw8o4@mail.deakin.edu.au>

Hello

My name is Lara Thynne and I am a PhD candidate at Deakin University
Australia.  I am currently researching the boundary between work and
leisure activities directly related to the open source community and
open source program development.

As part of this I am running a survey at the following address.

https://dcarf.deakin.edu.au/surveys/oss/

The survey is completely confidential and looks at your views and
motivations to use Open Source software and to participate in the
community.

It will only take a five to ten minutes to complete and your contact
details will not be recorded. You can withdraw your participation at
any stage.

I sincerely apologize for the spammish nature of this e-mail - I
don't mean to abuse this list.  I am trying to collect responses
from as many open source developers and users as possible and a
mailing list like can be the only way to reach many developers.

Thanks again

Lara

P.S The program that I am using is open source, of course
(www.phpsurveyor.org)!

try the command "Xorg -configure"  it'll dump a config file in you home
directory.
all you need is edit it a little bit and put it in /etc/X/xorg.conf  i
think...
oh.. btw... use /dev/psaux at the mouse device. or /dev/input/mice

Subject: [Delilinux-user] Problem writing the MBR
Message-ID: <200703302323.23907.znnse@griesstaett>

Hello,

up to now i installed DeLi on different machines. And it worked fine. But 
trying to install it on an old Siemens Mobile 360 i could not save the MBR. 
What can i try to do?
Is there a possibility to boot the DiLi written to disk by another way 
(floppy)?

Thanks for help!

Michael.
