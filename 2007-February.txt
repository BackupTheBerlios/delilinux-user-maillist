Subject: [Delilinux-user] howto install deli without CD and USB
Message-ID: <45CF4DB1.3040709@gmxpro.de>

Hello

I'm planning to re-use my ancient notebook for a small linux installation.
The prombelm is, this notebook has no CD-ROM and no USB.
Can I install deli linux to this machine? And if so, how do I do this?
I read something about installing with a boot floppy via parallel or 
serial port, but I cannot find the mentioned files on the Website or on 
the downloaded CD image 0.7.1.
Did this method work only for older versions? If so, is it possible to 
dowload such an older version somwhere?

Regards
Matthias

I've never done it but I think SLIP or PLIP can be used:
