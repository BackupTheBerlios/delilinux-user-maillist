Subject: [Delilinux-user] make boot floppy
Message-ID: <fad481630803250016l65d3e3bfy8f5d531532b3d9aa@mail.gmail.com>

I downloaded the CD iso but it doesn't boot.  So I downloaded the boot, root
and mod images to make floppies but the following command doesn't work.

Output:
[root at localhost Desktop]# dd if=deliboot.dsk of=/dev/fd0
dd: writing to `/dev/fd0': Input/output error
9+0 records in
8+0 records out
4096 bytes (4.1 kB) copied, 1.26894 seconds, 3.2 kB/s

Doing dd --help gives a long list of options but I am not linux or computer
enough savvy to understand them  Can anyone help please?  Many thanks
