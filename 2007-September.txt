Subject: [Delilinux-user] How do I add support for ISA modem?
Message-ID: <263444.66897.qm@web54503.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I want to use DeLi Linux on a Packard Bell computer. I
got it to install fine. But what good is it if I can't
connect to the Internet? I want to use the internal
modem. I think it is ISA. How do I get it to detect
it?  Is there even a driver for such a old WinModem? I
tried pnpdump but it didn't work. I also tried the
wvdialconf command written below, but DeLi Linux
doesn't seem to have this command yet. And the
scanModem.gz seemed to hang after a grep command to
the screen and complained about an old device.
Modem.txt still printed out though. Please see below
for my modem model. I heard I should also run
isapnptools and use a "set" command to explicitly
state the COM and IRQ, but am not sure how to do that.

Sorry about the length of my post.

If wvdial is installed on your System, try modem
detection with
$ su - root
# wvdialconf  /etc/wvdial.conf

If not you can try interrogating the /dev/ttyS0 to 3
ports with
whatever COMM tooles are provided in DeLi  Linux
