Subject: [Delilinux-user] Building in a Clean Chroot
Message-ID: <1263122905.25653.13.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

I'm using ArchLinux on my computer, but recently I installed DeliLinux
on my parents computer (which is ancient), now I want to be able to
build packages in a clean chroot environment via my ArchLinux, reason
for this is I can't use my ArchLinux packages on DeliLinux althought
they're pacman compatible.
(The errors are: file not found when I try to execute the binaries, e.g>
-bash: /usr/bin/xarchiver: No such file or directory)

So how to setup the clean chroot?
This is what I do for ArchLinux>
sudo mkarchroot <chrootdir>/root base base-devel sudo
(http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_Clean_Chroot#Prerequisites)

I think it should be like this>
sudo mkarchroot -C <deli/pacman.conf> -M <deli/makepkg.conf>
<chrootdir>/root current
where deli is a folder with the custom conf files, am I correct ?

Message-ID: <201001102201.17567.luis.davila.pc@gmail.com>

hi, I recently discovered DeliLinux.  I did install Deli 0.8.0  
in an old laptop Toshiba 320 CDS Pentium MMX 233MHz 32MB ram, 
all works fine (no so faster, it's normal, but I will try with 
an oldest version too).  The only problem is with my pcmcia 
wireless card (atheros chip)

I would be make some test to make a PKGBUILD to easy install 
atheros drivers (madwifi) (if that is possible) but in that 
laptop take more time.... so.. I did install it in my Desktop PC 
(archlinux) with VirtualBox but after install, when I rebooted  
I have this message:
"FATAL: no bootable medium found! System halted"

somebody has an idea to this problem?

thanks... 

and it's really nice to discover this distribution for old 
machines.. 

Luis
