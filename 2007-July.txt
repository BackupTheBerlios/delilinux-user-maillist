Subject: [Delilinux-user] [Beginner] Internal PCI Modem setup & general
	questions
Message-ID: <93b1a1580707011119k74391302qf528a242a43ba62d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

first of all congratulations to those who made Delilinux: I've successfully
installed it with no trouble on an old Pentium I, 233 MHz with 64 Megs of
RAM. It's the (old) PC of my sister and she complained Win98 was just too
slow.
Now Delilinux runs very well!

One thing I could not figure out is: how do I setup the remaining hardware
like the internal PCI modem? Under suSE and ubuntu there're visual control
center tools like yast and the like.

I would need to configure modem and sound card. How do I add other users?
Must I still do this by bash or is there a GUI "control center" available
somewhere?

Thanks in advance
Pasquale
